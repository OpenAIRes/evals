While social media can have both positive and negative effects on mental health, it is crucial to consider individual differences, usage patterns, and the content consumed on these platforms.\n",

      "Research suggests that excessive use of social media, comparison with others, cyberbullying, and exposure to unrealistic standards can contribute to negative mental health outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. However, social media can also provide social support, facilitate connections, and offer a platform for self-expression and advocacy, which can have positive effects on mental well-being.\n",

      "To address the negative impact of social media on mental health, interventions such as promoting digital literacy, encouraging mindful usage, providing mental health resources, and fostering a supportive online environment can be beneficial. It is essential for individuals, parents, educators, mental health professionals, and policymakers to work together to create a healthier digital environment and promote positive mental health outcomes in the age of social media.\n",
